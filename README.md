# Environment builder for Angular build facade
This builder converts the dotenv to its equivalent environment.ts that can be used by the angular cli.

This is useful in production and infrastructure builds of AWS ECS/EKS and Google Kubernetes where the environment variables
determine the built image result and lessens maintenance of different builds due to Container managing the variables for 
the builds themselves.

This builder followed and improved on [Angular CLI 6 under the hood â€” builders demystified](https://medium.com/@meltedspark/angular-cli-6-under-the-hood-builders-demystified-f0690ebcf01).

## Usage

  1. In the root of your Angular application:
        ```
        npm i -D @flatxph/environment
        npm i -D dotenv
        npm i -D @types/dotenv
        ```
  2. In your _angular.json_ add the following to _architect_ section of the relevant project:
        ```
        "environment": {
          "builder": "@flatxph/environment:file",
          "options": {}
        },
        ```
  3. Create a file name _environment.build.ts_ on _src/environments_. This file will have access to the NodeJS environment.
        This is a sample environment.build.ts
        ```
        import { Environment } from './model';

        export const environment: Environment = {
            production: !!process.env.PRODUCTION || false,
            maps: {
                apiKey: process.env.MAPS_API_KEY,
                libraries: process.env.MAPS_LIBRARIES ? process.env.MAPS_LIBRARIES.split(',') : [],
            },
            title: process.env.TITLE || '',
            description: process.env.DESCRIPTION || '',
            fbAppId: parseInt(process.env.FB_APP_ID, 10) || 0,
            url: process.env.URL || '',
            twitter: process.env.TWITTER || '',
            image: process.env.IMAGE || '',
            imageWidth: parseInt(process.env.IMAGE_WIDTH, 10) || 0,
            imageHeight: parseInt(process.env.IMAGE_HEIGHT, 10) || 0,
            appId: process.env.APP_ID || '',
        };
        ```
  4. Run: `ng run [relevant-project]:environment`
     Where _[relevant-project]_ is the project to which you've added the target
  5. Add the generated files to `.gitignore` for cleaner repository
        ```
        ...
        /src/environments/*.js
        /src/environments/*.js.map
        ```
  6. Create a run script on `package.json` to automate the process
        ```
        "scripts" {
        ...
        "environment": "ng run [relevant-project]:environment",
        "prestart": "npm environment",
        ...
        }
        ```
  7. For Local Development, add a `.env` file to the root directory to add custom environment variables.
  For Live Deployment, please use the actual environment variables instead or add a custom file to the build steps.

## Options

 - `src` - path to the file with build environment, Defaults to `src/environments/environment.build`. The `.ts` part of the file should be omitted.
 - `dotenvConfigOptions` - This is a DotenvConfigOption based on package `@types/dotenv`. Defaults to `{}`
 - `model` - The model used as environment check. Typically named `Environment`. Defaults to `null`
 - `modelPath` - This is the path of the model for the environment. Typically `app/environments/model`. Defaults to `null`
 - `template` - This is the template file to use to render the environment. Defaults to `null`
 - `templateVariables` - These are custom variables that can be used in the template. Defaults to `{}`.
 - `output` - This is the output file. Default to `src/environments/environment.ts`

## Development

If you want to create your own builder like this, to upload to npm, run `yarn public` to publish.

Sample Projects are provided in the `examples` directory.
* Minimal - this is a minimal setup of an angular project with the builder installed.
